      Moderators have power over the message board, including the power to remove posts that violate the [terms of service](https://bbs.example.com/terms). As a member of moderation staff you can also temporarily or permanently restrict a user from posting.

      Here's an overview of your powers:

      - Deleting messages and threads.
      - Removing media on posts.
      - Redacting messages and media.

      Talk to your server administrator before using the `redact` feature, as some server versions crash when you try to redact content on them.

      Messages sent by the system are shown to all users currently online, even if they are not on the message page.

      Let me tell you how to construct nice system messages. Make sure they are clear, okay? Not doing so sure would be bad, and confusing for users!

      description: |
        Returns all draft system messages.

        These are messages that have been uploaded to the `moderation` proposed section, but have not yet been posted.

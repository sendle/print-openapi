# Print OpenAPI

This tool takes an OpenAPI file and spits out a printable HTML file. Since most browsers have a 'Print to PDF' function, you can use this to generate nice PDFs of your OpenAPI specs.

**Why?**

Most OpenAPI tooling focuses on creating fancy displays that you can click on, send API requests with, etc. But sometimes you just need a plain, easily-readable, static copy of your API docs. This gives you that!

**How?**

This relies a fair bit on the OpenAPI tooling released by [ReadMe](https://github.com/readmeio). Go check them out if you're after a nice developer hub – their offering is pretty cool!
